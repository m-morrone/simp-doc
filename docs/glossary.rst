   ACL
   Access Control List
      A list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users
      or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what
      operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical ACL
      specifies a subject and an operation.

   AIDE
   Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment
      An intrusion detection system for checking the integrity of files under
      Linux. AIDE can be used to help track file integrity by comparing a
      snapshot of the system's files prior to and after a suspected incident.
      It is maintained by Rami Lehti and Pablo Virolainen.

   Auditd
      The userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It is responsible
      for writing audit records to the disk. Viewing the logs is done with the
      ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring the audit rules is done with
      the auditctl utility. During startup, the rules in /etc/audit/audit.rules
      are read by auditctl. The audit daemon itself has some configuration
      options that the admin may wish to customize.  They are found in the
      auditd.conf file.

      TLS and :term:`SSL` encrypt the segments of network connections above the
      Transport Layer, using asymmetric cryptography for privacy and a keyed
      message authentication codes for message reliability.

      See also :term:`SSL`.

   TFTP
   Trivial File Transfer Protocol
      A file transfer protocol generally used for automated transfer of
      configuration or boot files between machines in a local environment.

   TPM
   Trusted Platform Module
      An international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, which is a
      dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware by integrating
      cryptographic keys into devices.

   TXT
   Trusted Execution Technology
      A hardware feature designed to harden platforms from the emerging threats
      of hypervisor attacks, BIOS, or other firmware attacks, malicious root kit
      installations, or other software-based attacks. It increases protection by
      allowing greater control of the launch stack through a Measured Launch
      Environment (MLE) and enabling isolation in the boot process.

   tboot
   Trusted Boot
     See :term:`TXT`.

   UEFI
   Unified Extensive Firmware Interface
      A specification that defines a software interface between an operating system
      and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
      firmware interface.

   UUID
   Universally Unique Identifier
      A 128-bit unique value that is generally written as groups of hexadecimal
      digits separated by hyphens.

      See also: UUIDGEN(1)

   TTY
      A Unix command that prints to standard output the name of the terminal
      connected to standard input. The name of the program comes from
      teletypewriter, abbreviated "TTY".

   umask
      Umask is a command that determines the settings of a mask that controls
      how file permissions are set for newly created files. It also may refer
      to a function that sets the mask, or it may refer to the mask itself,
      which is formally known as the file mode creation mask. The mask is a
      grouping of bits, each of which restricts how its corresponding
      permission is set for newly created files. The bits in the mask may be
      changed by invoking the umask command.

   Vagrant
      A tool for building complete development environments. With an
      easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development
      environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and
      makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

   VM
   Virtual Machine
      An isolated guest operating system installation running within a host
      operating system.

   VNC
   Virtual Network Computing
      A graphical desktop sharing system that uses the remote framebuffer (RFB)
      protocol to control another computer remotely. It transmits the keyboard
      and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical
      screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

   WAN
   Wide Area Network
      A computer networking technology used to transmit ata over long
      distances, and between different Local Area Networks (LANs),
      Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), and other localized computer
      networking architectures.

   X.509
      An ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure (PKI) and Privilege
      Management Infrastructure (PMI). X.509 specifies, amongst other things,
      standard formats for public key certificates, certificate revocation
      lists, attribute certificates, and a certification path validation
      algorithm.
