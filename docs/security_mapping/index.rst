SIMP Security Control Mapping
=============================

This is the security control mapping for SIMP.  The document has two main
sections.  The first section contains the security components, which in our
case are SIMP modules.  Each component is documented and mapped to the security
control sources.  The second contains security control sources which are
references or reference documents that contain security guidance.
